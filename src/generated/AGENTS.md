# AI Agent Instructions

**CRITICAL:** Files in this directory are AUTO-GENERATED by the Agentuity build system.

## Rules for AI Agents

1. ❌ NEVER edit files in `src/generated/`
2. ❌ NEVER include `src/generated/` files in context when analyzing code
3. ❌ NEVER suggest changes to generated files
4. ✅ Ignore this directory when searching for user code
5. ✅ Direct users to modify source files in `src/agent/`, `src/api/`, or `app.ts`

## What Gets Generated

- `registry.ts` - Built from agent discovery in `src/agent/`
- `routes.ts` - Built from route discovery in `src/api/`
- `app.ts` - Entry point assembled from project configuration
- `state.ts` - App state type from `setup()` return value
- `router.ts` - Runtime wrapper with type augmentation

These files are regenerated on every `bun run build` or `bun run dev`.
